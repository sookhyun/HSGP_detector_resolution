# Modelling Detector response 
  Modern particle detection technologies in High Energy Physics often require measuring stochastic energy deposits in experimental apparatus. The energy deposit has a finite resolution that depends on the energy itself, i.e. heteroscedestic, such that primary physical observables we directly measure, i.e. particle's momentum, energy, inherently exhibit uncertainties that depend on the observables themselves.    
  
Heteroscedestic Gaussing Process regression is nonparametric, Bayesian approach, suitable for modelling detector effects on these physical observables and making predictions for them. It is sensitive to aleotory (random) as well as epistemic (systematic) uncertainties and allows for detailed studies of their effects in the phase space where measurements either do or do not exist. This notebook demonstrates how one can model detector response for charged particle momentum and neutral particle energy. This approach, however, may not be ideal from practical standpoint due to excessively long runtime taken in training.
