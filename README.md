# Modelling Detector response 
  Modern particle detection technologies in High Energy Physics often require measuring stochastic energy deposits in experimental apparatus. The energy deposit has a resolution that depends on the energy itself such that relevant physical observables, i.e. particle's momentum, energy, inherently exhibit aleotory uncertainties that depend on the observables themselves.    
  
Heteroscedestic Gaussing Processes are nonparametric, Bayesian regression method, suitable for modelling and predicting these observables. This notebook demonstrates how one can model detector response for charged particle momentum and neutral particle energy.
