# Modelling Detector response 
  Modern particle detection technologies in High Energy Physics often require measuring stochastic energy deposits in experimental apparatus. The energy deposit has a resolution that depends on the energy itself such that relevant physical observables, i.e. particle's momentum, energy, inherently exhibit uncertainties that depend on the observables themselves.    
  
Heteroscedestic Gaussing Process regression is nonparametric, Bayesian method, suitable for modelling detector response and predicting these observables. It is sensitive to aleotory (random) as well as epistemic (systematic) uncertainties and allows for detailed studies of their effects. This This notebook demonstrates how one can model detector response for charged particle momentum and neutral particle energy.
